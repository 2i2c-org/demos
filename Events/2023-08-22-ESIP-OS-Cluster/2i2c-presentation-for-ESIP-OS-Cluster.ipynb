The OS Cluster, launched in Spring 2022, gathers and shares knowledge with the aim of increasing awareness and adoption of open science. We have designed this webinar series to highlight and increase awareness around the following open science themes: trust in open science; open science infrastructure considerations; and open science incentives. \n",

We would be delighted if you could **present on your efforts around open science infrastructure (these are just some ideas) > why you started 2i2c; what benefits to open science are there from working in the cloud; what are the challenges from an infrastructure standpoint; what does the future look like. We suggest a ~30 minute presentation followed by time for Q&A.** \n",
